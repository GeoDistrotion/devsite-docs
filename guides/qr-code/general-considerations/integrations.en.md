# How to generate QR codes

Depending on your business needs, you have different options when it comes to creating QR codes. You can also combine methods to offer your client a unique buying experience in your physical store.


## Generating QR from Mercado Pago front page

This is the simplest way to charge with QR: you **don't need an integration between your system and Mercado Pago in order to work**.
There are various ways of doing it. Consult all available information to [generate QR from the front page](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/en/guides/qr-code/general-considerations/integrations-front/).

## Generating integrated QR 

Provide a more complete experience for QR payments by **integrating your system with Mercado Pago**.

You’ll be able to charge, refund and receive notifications in your system. Pick one of these integration models:

| Integration type                                                        | Features                                                  | Operation |   Business examples |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Attended model | Requires intervention from the operator in a point of sale. Select Mercado Pago as a payment method. | Operator takes the order. Next, client scans QR to pay for the order. | Stores, fast food restaurants. |
| Unattended model | Intervention from an operator is not required.  | Client scans QR. Once product or service is ready, client pays the value informed by an operator.  | Gas stations, vending machines, business integrated with multiple virtual wallets. |
