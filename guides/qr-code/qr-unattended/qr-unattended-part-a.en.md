# QR unattended model


## What’s QR unattended model?

With this model, you won’t have to **create a specific payment order on Mercado Pago**. The order is generated by choosing a product or service and scanning the QR on the Point of Sale (POS).
We recommend this model for gas stations, vending machines and systems integrated with multiple wallets.

## Model features

The main characteristics are:

- Each Point of Sale has an associated URL to which Mercado Pago will ask if there is an order ready to pay.
- When a client scans the QR code in a Point of Sale, Mercado Pago sends a recurrent request to the URL associated on the POS. When order is ready, it will show the amount to pay in the client app. 
- Client will be able to pay only if there’s an order created for the scanned QR. 

> NOTE

> Note
> 
> The URL should point to a service under your domain where you can display if there are pending orders for each Point of Sale of your store.

## Model flow

This is how the QR unattended model works:
