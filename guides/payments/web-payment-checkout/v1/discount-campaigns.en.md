# Discount campaigns

> WARNING

> This documentation refers to the new version of the Checkout Mercado Pago.

> Remember there is only active support and new functionalities for the [new version of the Checkout Mercado Pago.](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/developers/en/guides/payments/web-payment-checkout/introduction/)

Create discount campaigns to boost your sales using the marketing tools of your Mercado Pago account in the section Configuration for your Business: [Create discount](https://www.mercadopago.com.ar/campaigns/create).

You can create two types of campaigns:

* Encompassing all your buyers, e.g. seasonal discounts
* With a discount code sent to your buyers.

All you should do is choose how much you want to invest and when, without any additional costs.

## Buyer experience

Before showing the checkout, Mercado Pago will check whether there is a campaign created for that buyer.

If the campaign is valid, the discount will be applied or a coupon will be requested. The discount will be automatically calculated and the promotional price will be displayed.

To find out whether a payment had any discount, you should check if `coupon_id` attribute is not `null`. Check the amount of discount in the `coupon_amount` attribute.
