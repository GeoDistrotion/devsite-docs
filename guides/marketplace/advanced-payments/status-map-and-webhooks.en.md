# Status map

An Advanced Payment can take different states.
A Marketplace can be informed of the status changes of an Advanced Payment if you subscribe to the 'Payment Split' topic in [Webhooks](https://www.mercadopago.com/mla/account/webhooks), for off cart payments.

# Webhooks Notifications

If you are subscribed to notifications, then you will receive a notification each time the Advanced Payment is modified.

The structure of the notification is as follows:

```json
{
  "id": 1111111,
  "user_id": 232323,
  "date_created": "2019-01-23T16:14:51.107-04:00",
  "action": "splitter.update",
  "status": "approved",
  "application_id": 9999999999999,
  "live_mode": "true",
  "version": 2,
  "data": {
    "id": "ext_ref_ibp"
  }
}
```

* `id`: Notification ID.
* `user_id`: ID of the Marketplace owner.
* `date_created`: Event date.
* `action`: Action that was made with respect to the Advanced Payment (can be splitter.insert or splitter.update).
* `status`: Status of the Advanced Payment.
* `application_id`: Application ID.
* `live_mode`: Indicates whether it is a productive (true) or sandbox (false) notification.
* `version`: Advanced Payment version.
* `data.id`: Advanced Payment ID.

# Binary Payment

You can define the payment so that the response is instantaneous or not.

In case it is instantaneous, the payment response will be `approved` or `rejected` (without intermediate states). On the contrary, the payment can be left as pending, for example, waiting for the payment to be credited in case of offline methods or credit card payments of high amounts where the buyer must call the card issuer to authorize the payment.

This logic can be managed by setting, at the root of the Advanced Payment, the `binary_mode` field as `true` to return the immediate response and `false` for the contrary.

```json
  "binary_mode": true
```
